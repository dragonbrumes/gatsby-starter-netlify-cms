Sometimes we feel broken from love or life and need something to express your feelings on your facebook timeline, twitter feeds or WhatsApp status. Here you go with sad quotes about love and sad quotes about life.

**Sad Quotes about Love**

1. Until the day I close my eyes and never open them again, you remain in my heart. I will never give up on you until that moment you find within you that something is missing in your life.
2. I can feel my heart ache because an essential part of it has left. My whole body and soul feel completely empty. This is too much for me to bear.
3. The pain my heart feels is just too much for it to bear. Nothing eases this pain. I can’t hold myself back. I really miss you.
4. You came into my life and taught me a lot of things. You left me in a shattered state, with a million memories that has haunted me all the while you left.
5. You left me when I needed you most. Just when I felt I have found peace, you went away with a piece of me. I need you.
6. I really miss you and want you in my life because things have not been the same since you left. There is nobody who fits to fill in the gap you left.
7. I don’t have to pretend to be fine when all I feel inside is pain and more pain. Things have changed the way they used to be. There is no more joy in the kingdom we created.
8. My heart feels empty and there is no easy way to feel better. Letting you go isn’t easy and holding on to you isn’t working either.
9. You felt me in a sad stage and my heart burns from the pain you gave to me. If you can stand and watch me burn, it won’t make me love you less.
10. I had to let go when all you do is cause me pain and sadness. That moment you felt comfortable hurting me what the moment my heart said: “enough is enough”.
11. One Pain

Life is when you realize, thousands of happiness can’t remove one pain in the heart.

But one pain can remove all the laughter you had in your heart.
